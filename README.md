## Setup

To run and continue development on this application in an IDE, you must first install the Android and Flutter SDKs.

Flutter SDK: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

Android SDK: https://developer.android.com/studio

For the Android SDK, you must install Android Studio. Android Studio comes packaged with the SDK, as well as an emulator you can optionally set up to run and test the application. You can run and test the application on a connected phone as well, in which case it will have to be configured using this guide: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device

Once everything has been installed and configured, the project can be opened in either Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA. Create a Flutter run configuration in your IDE of choice that points to the main.dart file in the project/lib directory, and run the project.
